            <h2>Urbanrunic Corporation Info</h2>
            <p>The company was founded after a few years of working with media, print and web design, in order to better the services that could be offered to clients. The passion for programming, design and multimedia drives us to be successful in our venture. At the start we were located in the heart of Maryland just outside Washington, D.C. but moved the company to sunny Florida in 2013 but still working mostly telecommute or traveling back and forth for meetings. With the technology today we don't have to be in one place to serve our clients, we are able to work with clients anywhere around the globe.</p>
